          <h3>Finally up and running!</h3>
          <p>
            After almost a week of trying to understand css, I've finally come up with a design that I liked. This design is heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/olav/frontend101">BEKK's frontend 101 course</a>. There's not a whole lot of content on this site right now, but hopefully there will be more later on.
            <br/>
            I'm still learning css and currently trying to make this site mobile friendly and maybe add in scripts and such to make it look more fancy, time will tell.
            <br/>
            There's still a lot to do before I can say that this website is up and running, currently trying to fix colors so it's visible for all the links on the different bg-colors, and all the links in the menu has to be put up.
